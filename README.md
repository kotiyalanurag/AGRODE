<h1 align=center>AGRODE</h1>

AGRODE aims to utilise various data analysis and visualisation techniques for explaining whether the current geographical, political, and logical scenarios 
would benefit North Germany from the use of Agrivoltaics or not. The states that come under the umbrella term of North Germany are **Bremen**, **Hamburg**, 
**Niedersachsen**, **Mecklenberg-Vorpommern**, and **Schleswig-Holstein**.

## What is Agrivoltaics?

It simply means that we use the same piece of land for farming and solar panel installations. Various researches have shown that by doing this, we can improve 
the land productivity by nearly twofolds. However, there is a slight caveat of crop selection that can be paired with solar panels. Only shade tolerant crops
like wheat, lettuce, potatoes, etc. can be used for agrivoltaics.

## Dataset Used

* [Marktdatenstammregister](https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR) - used for obtaining data about PV intallations by applying various filters
* [Taxation Rates](https://www.dihk.de/de/themen-und-positionen/wirtschaftspolitik/steuer-und-finanzpolitik/hebesaetze-56878) - used for obtaining tax data for 
PV installations in different districts

## Bried Description

* SECTION 1 - Data Cleaning

* SECTION 2 - Solar Data Analysis

* SECTION 3 - Energy Source Analysis

* SECTION 4 - Geospatial Analysis

* SECTION 5 - Tax Data Analysis

## Summary

* all Northern states have higher number of solar plant installations than any other energy source

* Coal is the main source of energy for Bremen and Hamburg while Wind drives our three bigger states

* Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has some of the biggest solar plants in North Germany

* Wind Energy has a much higher potential for North Germany as compared to Solar Energy 

* more installation are found in areas with lesser rate for Property Tax B

* despite having lower tax rates Mecklenburg-Vorpommern focuses more on Wind energy

* future planned installation of PV are mostly on rooftops to avoid conflict with farmers

* EEG subsidy for PV installation has not been adapted by North Germany

* soil quality in North is good for crops like potato that can be used for agrivoltaics

* a viable option for North Germany can be Hybrid plants - install solar panels on wind farms
